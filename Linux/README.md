# LINUX PRACTICE

EXERCISE 3: Bash Script - User Processes
Write a bash script using Vim editor that checks all the processes running for the current user (USER env var) and prints out the processes in console. Hint: use ps aux command and grep for the user.

EXERCISE 4: Bash Script - User Processes Sorted
Extend the previous script to ask for a user input for sorting the processes output either by memory or CPU consumption, and print the sorted list.

EXERCISE 5: Bash Script - Number of User Processes Sorted
Extend the previous script to ask additionally for user input about how many processes to print. Hint: use head program to limit the number of outputs.
